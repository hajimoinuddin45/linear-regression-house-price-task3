# 🏡 Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

This repository contains my work for **Task 3** focused on implementing **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using a House Price dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand and apply linear regression models.
- Predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the house price dataset.
   - Handled missing values.
2. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - Used `area` to predict `price`.
   - Visualized the regression line.
   - Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R².
3. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   - Used `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms` as features.
   - Interpreted coefficients to understand impact.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared actual vs predicted values.
   - Plotted and analyzed performance.

## 📊 Key Observations

- Larger areas generally correlate with higher prices.
- Bedrooms and bathrooms also positively impact the price.
- Simple linear regression captured the trend but multiple regression provided better prediction accuracy.

## 📚 What I Learned

- The meaning of coefficients in linear models.
- How to interpret R² (coefficient of determination).
- MAE and MSE are crucial for understanding model errors.
- Importance of splitting data into train-test sets.
- How multicollinearity between independent variables can affect regression models.
